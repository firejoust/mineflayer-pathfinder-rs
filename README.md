## Mineflayer Pathfinder (Rust Implementation)
Get your minecraft bot from point A to B

```
WIP (short term):
- Reading chunk data directly from shared memory (node -> Rust)
- Create the pathfinding algorithm
- Simple movements algorithm to follow the path
- Node consideration for placing/digging blocks
- Update the movements algorithm for placing/digging blocks
- Multithread the pathfinding algorithm

long term goals:
- Simulated player physics engine: hitbox/block collision
- Implementing path postprocessing for complicated movement support (jumps)
- Advanced pathfinding goals (out of range, avoid, etc)
```
